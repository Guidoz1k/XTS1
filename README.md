## XTS1
Basic demo for the XTS1 sensor from ToFFuture Technologies.\
Made this demo after some people requested it from YouTube's comment section.

The demo project can be found in the XT-S1_ESPIDF folder.\
Datasheet comes directly from the manufacturer.\
Code written using Visual Code, Platform Io, ESP-IDF framework, purple ESP32-S3 devkit.

There's also a folder call "test program", which contains a program from the manufacturer
to test the LiDAR module. I never used it but you may find it useful for something.
